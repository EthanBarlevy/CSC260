<h1>What I Was Like @ViewData["Title"] Neumont</h1>

<p>
    Before coming to Neumont, I was a little more shy and reserved. I was actually eating more unhealthily
    than I am now. I certainly had more freetime before I went to Neumont so I was gaming a lot more than 
    I am now. I was able to bake a lot more than I used to.
</p>
<p>
    As might be expected I was also a lot less educated than I am now. My overall mental health was worse.
    I had less empathy for the people around me but I believe that that changed more from me getting older.
